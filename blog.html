<h2 id="htmll" class="ps">My HTML Learning<h2>
<p class="paragraph">I have learned a lot of things in HTML5 so far. I have learned ways to format, change shapes, fonts, blod and italic, make headings and paragraphs, and much, much more. In general, I feel like I have mastered the basics, and I am very eager to learn more about what I can do with HTML.<p>

<p class="paragraph">This is not all I have learned with HTML, though. In class, we have done a lot of projects, like make a our own recipe book. I found this part of the assignment very tedious because of the tables, there were a lot of specific ways in which you needed to format them, so it made it complicated.<p>

<h2 id="csshl" class="ps">My CSS Learning<h2>
<p class="paragraph">I have also learned a lot of skills using CSS. I feel like CSS is a lot more fun, because you get to play around with colors, shapes, and different effects of the HTML. I have seen CSS in action and I am aware that it can do amazing things, so I am excited to see what we learn next. Hopefully we will keep on learning.<p>

<p class="paragraph">I also in particular found the recipe book assignment very cool and fun to work with in CSS. I learned a lot of things about different ways in which to align tables, margins, and ways to style text. Lists were complicated, because when I did ordered lists and centered it, the text would center, but not the number.<p>
